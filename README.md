## Setup for commits

Developers must run the "install_githooks.sh" script in order to add any pre-commit hooks.
At the moment, one pre-commit hook will be installed which runs a linting commandon the `*.py` files.

## Traffic Capture

The TrafficCapture directory hosts a set of projects designed to facilitate the proxying and capturing of HTTP
traffic, which can then be offloaded and replayed to other HTTP(S) server(s).

More documentation on this directory including the projects within it can be found here: [Traffic Capture](TrafficCapture/README.md) 

### Local Docker Solution

A containarized end-to-end solution can be deployed locally using Docker.

More documentation on this solution can be found here:
[Docker Solution](TrafficCapture/dockerSolution/README.md)

### End-to-End Testing

Developers can run a test script which will verify the end-to-end Local Docker Solution.

More documentation on this test script can be found here:
[End-to-End Testing](test/README.md)

## Deploying to AWS with Copilot
